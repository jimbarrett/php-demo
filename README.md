# PHP Demo Task Manager

A simple task manager. meant to demonstrate the way we used to create PHP applications.
Pretty basic...no ORM or package manager or framework. Just a little something for fun.
There's not much that useful here and certainly nothing I'm likely to reuse elsewhere, but the router is pretty cool.
